# App development:
The app was made using MIT App Inventor blocks and design

# Connecting stepper motor to hose splitter
This part was made to make sure that only the plants that need water will get it.(let's say part of the plants need less water or exposed less to the sun.)
The connection was made by a screwdriver, Coca-Cola cork and hard electricity wires.

# Project summery:
The plant watering can be fully automatic, It works on ground humidity and light exposure.
If the ground is dry and it's night time, The system will be activate.
The android app is a way to pass the automatic system and water the plants when ever you like to.
